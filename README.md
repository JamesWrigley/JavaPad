A Java-oriented code sharing app (#WGTNAndroidHackathon)

This app was created with software developers in mind. Our vision was that this would be a handy tool for devs to send code snippets to themselves when they have an idea and are away from their workstation. Java 8, 7, 6, & 5 documentations are included for easy access to them without having to go on your mobile web brower and search it up. This app idea was inspired by the Android Hackathon 2016 at Victoria University. We didn't want to make an app for the event, we wanted to make something that could be useful to many people.
